                    <h3 class="fs-38 my-3 text-center fw-600">How it works</h3>
                    <p class="mt-2">BackaBuddy is a South African crowdfunding platform that is designed to help you create online campaigns to raise funds for causes you are passionate abou</p>
                    <h4 class="fs-20 mt-3">What sort of campaigns can be created on BackaBuddy?</h4>
                    <p class="mt-2">You can create campaigns for anything that has a positive impact on individuals, communities, and the environment.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2">These campaigns can raise funds for organisations or for individuals who need donations for a variety of reasons, including medical procedures, sporting opportunities, or for studies. You can even create campaigns in loving memory of a special person to raise funds for his or her favourite cause.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2">We love campaigns that make use of our ‘champion’ model – raising funds on behalf of an organisation or an individual in need. While you are welcome to fundraise for yourself, campaigns that help others, friends or strangers, are powerful reminders of all the good there is in the world.</p>
                    <div class="mt-3">
                        <h4 class="fs-20">How does it work?</h4>
                        <p class="mt-2">You can quickly and easily create a fundraiser on the BackaBuddy site, then share your campaign link with your friends, family, and colleagues – your crowd - to invite monetary donations. Creating a campaign is free and there are no charges if you don’t raise funds.</p>
                        <p class="mt-2">There are no time limits imposed on campaigns and no penalties if you don’t reach your target. You can also carry on receiving donations after you’ve met your target.</p>
                        <p class="mt-2">Simply put, your campaign can continue for as long as you like. You do not have to reach your target or a certain amount to receive your donations. You have the flexibility to request a payout at any time, provided your campaign/organisation has been vetted and you have received donations. Please note that the processing time for payouts by BackaBuddy is up to 10 business days. Additionally, you can only submit a new payout request once the previous one has been successfully processed. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="mt-3">
                        <h4 class="fs-20">Organisation Registrations</h4>
                        <p class="mt-2">If you are an organisation, crowdfunding is a transparent and effective way to fundraise for specific needs within your organisation. First you simply register by completing this form. We’ll create your organisation profile page, and then you (and your supporters) can create as many fundraising campaigns as you’d like!</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="mt-3">
                        <h4 class="fs-20">What makes BackaBuddy different from other crowdfunding platforms?</h4>
                        <p class="mt-2">BackaBuddy takes integrity really seriously, which is why we like to ‘vet’ individual campaigns and organisations' registrations before any payouts can be processed. This way, our site users and donors can be assured that we take steps to protect them to the best of our ability.</p>
                        <p class="mt-2">Funds raised can only be paid out once the campaign/organisation has been verified and banking details have been received. You can read more here about what this involves. Once you have met the criteria in place and we consider your fundraiser to be authentic with donations received, you can request a payout on funds raised. Please note that the processing time for payouts by BackaBuddy is up to 10 business days. Additionally, you can only submit a new payout request once the previous one has been successfully processed.</p>
                        <p class="mt-2">BackaBuddy offers campaign creators the option of BackaBuddy administering the campaign. “Bluetick Campaigns” or “BackaBuddy Assisted” means paying part or all of the funds eligible for payout to a <span class="fs-14">vendor/organisation/company/professional</span> directly upon presentation of invoices or similar transaction proof, instead of paying funds directly to the bank account of the individual campaign creator or beneficiary. Although it is not essential, having funds paid directly to a vendor or institution is almost always preferred by donors.</p>

We may use these technologies to determine fundraising campaign traffic patterns on our website. This information helps us make the website more rewarding and helps us improve the effectiveness of our customer communications. We also use cookies to customize your experience and provide greater convenience each time you interact with us. For example, your profile information and information about your computer helps us operate the website efficiently.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3">As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. BackaBuddy will not use this type of collected information to market directly to that person. We may share aggregated anonymous information with third parties to assist in analyzing, operating, maintaining, and improving the website and placing advertising on it.</p>

When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. We may track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of customer communications.

Clickstream Data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of the website from which you linked to our website. We may use Clickstream Data as a form of non-personal information to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on each page of the website, how visitors navigate throughout the website and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors.

Please also go and see our Privacy and Cookies Policies (which you’re also agreeing to by using the Services).</p>
                            <p class="mt-3">Sometimes we might change these Terms. We’ll do our best to notify you personally of any changes (if we have your details), but in any event, we will also inform our community of these changes by posting a notice on the Site.</p>
                            <p class="mt-3">BackaBuddy is only for your personal, non-commercial use. BackaBuddy is for online fundraisers (referred to here as campaigns) that collect monetary donations only.

If you’d like to register your organisation, please do so here. You will need to create, or already have, a profile to register either. You can also browse BackaBuddy without registering a profile.

We reserve the right to cancel your campaign or organisation registration if you don’t comply with any of these Terms.</p>
                            <p class="mt-3">Please remember that if you do choose to register for any of the above, you are responsible for all the activity on your profile, and for keeping your password confidential.

                            <h5 class= "fs-20 mt-3">Contract between Organisation and Contributor</h5>
                            <p class="mt-3">BackaBuddy provides a funding platform for organisations and charitable campaigns. When someone publishes a charitable campaign on BackaBuddy, they invite other people to form a legal contract with them. Anyone who contributes to an organisation (a donor) is accepting the organisation’s offer and forming that contract.</p>
                            <p class="mt-4">BackaBuddy is not a part of this contract — the contract is a direct legal agreement between organisations and their contributors. Here are the terms that govern that agreement:</p>
                            <ul class="list">
                                <li>When a campaign is successfully funded, the organisation must use the funds for the purpose advertised. Once an organisation has done this, it has satisfied its obligation to its contributors.</li>
                                <li>Throughout the process, organisations owe their contributors a high standard of effort, honesty, transparency and a commitment to achieving the advertised goals of that organisation.</li>
                                <li>Contributors must understand that there could be delays in an organisation achieving what it has set out to do.</li>
                                <li>A donation is an irrevocable and unconditional act and, once a donation has been made using the Services, the contributor is not entitled to a refund unless the relevant organisation agrees to the refund and special arrangements are made directly with the organisation. Once an organisation has refunded the contributor it has no further obligation to that contributor, and no further agreement exists between the two parties.</li>
                                <li>BackaBuddy is not responsible for the fulfillment of the promises made by organisations.</li>
                                <li>If organisations are unable to satisfy the terms of their agreement, they may be subject to legal action by contributors.</li>
                                <li>When donating to a campaign for an organisation, the organisation will receive certain information such as donor names and email addresses. It is the organisation’s responsibility to keep this information private and use it solely for the purposes of participating in the BackaBuddy campaigns. Do not share or distribute any user information without their permission.</li>
                                <li>When creating a campaign for an organisation, the organisation will receive certain information such as champion names and email addresses. It is the organisation’s responsibility to keep this information private and use it solely for the purposes of participating in the BackaBuddy campaigns. Do not share or distribute any user information without their permission.</li>

                            <p class="mt-3">While every effort will be taken to ‘vet’ campaigns for individuals, BackaBuddy ultimately cannot warrant that your donations will be used for any particular purpose and shall not be responsible for any dissatisfaction you may have regarding the recipient individual's use of any donation you may make through the website or for any misuse or non-use of such donations by the recipient individual cause.</p>
                            <p class="mt-3">After donations are made, all further dealings are solely between the donor and such recipient.</p>
                            <p class="mt-3">BackaBuddy shall have no liability to donors whatsoever for any use or misuse of donations made to a BackaBuddy Crowdfunding page. The BackaBuddy Crowdfunding page may state that they will use donations only for specific purposes, but BackaBuddy cannot guarantee that they will use it for such a purpose.</p>
                            <p class="mt-3">It is your sole responsibility, as a user of the site, to ensure that the cause stated to be supported on a relevant BackaBuddy page is one that you wish to support.</p>

                            <p class="mt-3">BackaBuddy takes the integrity of individual campaigns seriously and will endeavour to ensure there is sufficient evidence for the legitimacy of campaign content. To this end, there are criteria in place that need to be met before a campaign is verified on the platform, and funds are paid out.</p>
                            <div class="mt-4">
                                <p class= "mt-3">We reserve the right to decline campaigns based on the following criteria:</p>
                                <ul class = "list">
                                    <li>Insufficient supporting information and/or campaign copy. This includes but is not limited to a lack of appropriate contactable references or supporting documentation that can be used to verify the campaign ‘cause’ at any stage of the process.</li>
                                    <li>Monetary targets that are not proportionate to the cause as stated in the campaign copy</li>
                                    <li>Campaigns that are raising funds for investment, speculation, or gambling.</li>
                                    <li>Campaigns that offer rewards or entry into a competition/raffle</li>
                                    <li>Campaigns that display inappropriate images or images subject to copyright</li>
                                    <li>Campaigns that aim to fund or form political parties, are political party affiliated or promote a political agenda.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p class="mt-3">BackaBuddy offers campaign creators the option of BackaBuddy administering the campaign. “Bluetick Campaigns” or “BackaBuddy Assisted” means paying part or all of the funds eligible for payout to a <span class="fs-14">vendor/organisation/company/professional</span> directly upon presentation of invoices or similar transaction proof, instead of paying funds directly to the bank account of the individual campaign creator or beneficiary. Although it is not essential, having funds paid directly to a vendor or institution is almost always preferred by donors. BackaBuddy reserves the right to convert any individual campaign to a Bluetick Campaign.</p>
                                <p class="mt-3">If during the course of your Bluetick Campaign, you would prefer that the funds be paid out directly to yourself or the beneficiary, BackaBuddy is required to send an email to your donors to confirm if they are happy to have the funds redirected or if they would prefer a refund. (Please refer to our section on refunds).</p>
                                <p class="mt-3">For both self-managed and Bluetick campaigns, it is the responsibility of the campaign creator to ensure the accuracy of the account details provided.</p>
                                <p class="mt-3">Campaign creators are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the banking details provided. BackaBuddy will not process payouts into a new or updated account if the originally provided details were incorrect, until the funds have been successfully recalled and returned by the bank. While BackaBuddy will make reasonable efforts to assist in the recall process, the campaign creator acknowledges that the responsibility for providing correct banking information lies solely with them, and any delays or losses resulting from incorrect details are not the responsibility of BackaBuddy.</p>
